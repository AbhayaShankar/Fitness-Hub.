      "overview": "The squat is the king of all exercises, working over 256 muscles in one movement! From bodybuilders to powerlifters to competitive athletes, the squat is a staple compound exercise and should be in every workout plan.<br /><br /> For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, having an explosive squat is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the squat is a compound exercise that targets nearly every muscle of your lower body and core. <br /> <br /> The squat directly targets the muscles of the quads, but also involves the hamstrings, glutes, back, and core as well as muscles of the shoulders and arms to a lesser degree. <br /> <br /> Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell back squat and it can result in some pain for certain individuals. Over the years, several squatting variations have been developed to help everyone be able to train this critical movement pattern safely.",

Ex: A normal pushup - major focus on chest while minor on back and triceps.<br/ > Switch it with Archer pushups - Major for shoulders and minor for core and arms or switch it to diamond pushup to target your inner chest and triceps. <br/ ><br/ >This exercise can be performed by beginners to experts, with a mild adjustment you can make this exercise difficult and try to achieve that level. <br/ ><br/ > Beginners can start from Knee pushups. Once you are able to do 10 knee pushups, you can try to do one normal pushup. Once you are able to do 5 normal pushup - you can try to do a wide stance pushup. If you are able to do 5 wide pushups - you can try a diamond pushup and so on to Archer pushup and then final finish it with a one arm pushup. <br/> <br/> Once you are able to do one arm pushups - you can also try weighted pushups where you can put on weighted bags or put plates of weight over your back while you perform the motion.",
